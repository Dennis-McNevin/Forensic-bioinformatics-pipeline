LobSTR	LobSTR	bwaq	Flank quality trim	int	1-40	15	Errors tend to accumulate at the ends of reads, which are reflected in the base quality scores. Trimming off these low quality ends results in better alignments [10]
		fft-window-size	FFT window size	int	12-60	40	FFT window size [16]
		fft-window-step	FFT window step	int	6-20	8	FFT window set [4]
		entropy-threshold	entropy threshold	float	0-1-2	0.40	Threshold score to call a window periodic
		minflank	Min flank size	int	1-30	8	Minimum flanking sequence [8]
		maxflank	Max flank size	int	35-500	300	Maximum flanking sequencing region [50]
		max-diff-ref	Max diff ref	int	100-2000	500	Don't report reads different in length by more than INT bp from the reference allele. If you are specifically interested in big expansions, you must set this to a number significantly higher than the expansion length you are looking for.
		mapq	Max mismatch MapQ	int	1-1000	200	Sum of qualities at base mismatches.	
		m	Num mismatches	int	0-5	3	Edit distance allowed during alignment of each flanking region. Set this higher to be more tolerable of alignment errors.
		g	Max gap opens	int	0-5	2	Maximum number of gap opens in each flanking region. Gap opens in flanking regions are often a signal of low quality alignment to the STR, so it is not recommended to increase this for short reads.
		e	Max gap extensions	int	0-5	1	Maximum number of gap extensions allowed in each flanking region. This is also set to 1 by default but can be increased if using very long reads.
		r	Edit distance	int	0-100	10	Edit distance allowed during alignment of each flanking region as a percentage of the read length. 
		min-read-length	Min read length	int	45-300	45	Don't process reads shorter than this
		max-read-length	Max read length	int	200-1024	1024	Don't process reads longer than this
		min-flank-allow-mismatch	Min flank with mismatch	int	1-60	15	Don't allow mismatches if flanking regions are shorter than this
