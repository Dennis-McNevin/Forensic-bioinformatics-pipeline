Shared	Universal arguments	r1	Forward FASTQ	file	required	.fq;.fastq;.bam;.ubam;.gz	File containing forward NGS reads in FASTQ or BAM format
		R	Reference file	file	optional	.fa;.fasta	FASTA file for indexed custom reference (default hg19)
		single	Read data	choice	auto-detect;single-end;paired-end	auto-detect	Single-end or paired-end reads file(s)
#		single	Reads data	choice	single-end;paired-end	single-end	Input is single- or paired-end reads file(s)
		threads	Processes	int	1-8	1	Maximum computational processes to run simultaneously

#Trimmomatic	Trimmomatic	a	Adapter file	file		.fa;.fasta	File containing adapter sequences
#		c	Clip  adapters	tickbox		unticked	Cut specific adapter sequences from reads
Trimmomatic	Trimmomatic	s	Sliding Window	tickbox		ticked	Perform sliding window trimming
		w	Window size	int	1-20	4	Number of bases to average across
		q	Average quality	int	1-40	15	Average quality required
		d	Minimum length reads	tickbox		unticked	Drop reads below a specified length
		m	Minimum bases	int	1-200	30	Minimum length of reads to be kept

LobSTR	LobSTR	min-border	Minimum border	int	0-40	5	Filter reads that do not extend past both ends of the STR region by at least <INT> bp. To include partially spanning reads, specify a large negative number.
		min-bp-before-indel	Min BP before indel	int	1-20	1	Filter reads with an indel occurring less than <INT> bases from either end of the read.
		maximal-end-match	Maximal end match	int	1-30	5	Filter reads whose prefix/suffix matches to reference are <= those obtained when shifting the read ends by distances within <INT> bp.
		min-read-end-match	Min read end match	int	1-20	5	Filter reads whose alignments don't exactly match the reference for at least <INT> bp at both ends.
