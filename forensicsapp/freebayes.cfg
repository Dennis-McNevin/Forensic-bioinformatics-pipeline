freebayes	Freebayes	t	Targets file (BED)	file	optional	.bed	Limit analyses to targets listed in the BED-format file
		haplotype-length	Num embedded matches	int	1-10	3	Allow haplotype calls with contiguous embedded matches of up to this length. [3]
		min-repeat-size	Min repeat length	int	1-10	5	When assembling observations across repeats, require the total repeat length at least this many bp. [5]
		min-repeat-entropy	Min repeat entropy (bits)	int	0-5	0	To detect interrupted repeats, build across sequence until it has entropy > N bits per bp. (default: 0, off)
		no-partial-observations	Exclude partial detection	tickbox	unticked	Exclude observations which do not fully span the dynamically-determined detection window. (default, use all observations, dividing partial support across matching haplotypes when generating haplotypes.)
		4	Use duplicate reads	tickbox	unticked	Include duplicate-marked alignments in the analysis. default: exclude duplicates marked as such in alignments
		m	Min mapping quality	int	0-60	20	Exclude alignments from analysis if they have a mapping quality less than Q. [1]
		q	Min base quality	int	0-40	20	Exclude alleles from analysis if their supporting base quality is less than Q. [0]
		R	Min supporting allele Qsum	int	0-200	0	Consider any allele in which the sum of qualities of supporting min observations is at least Q. [0]
		Y	Min supporting mapping Qsum	int	0-200	0	Consider any allele in which and the sum of mapping qualities of supporting reads is at least Q. [0]
		Q	Min mismatch base Q	int	0-60	10	Count mismatches toward --read-mismatch-limit if the base quality of the mismatch is >= Q. [10]
#		U	Read mismatch limit	int	0-1000	100	Exclude reads with more than N mismatches where each mismatch has base quality >= mismatch-base-quality-threshold.
		z	Read max mismatch fraction	float	0-1-2	1.0	Exclude reads with more than N [0,1] fraction of mismatches where each mismatch has base quality >= mismatch-base-quality-threshold default: 1.0
#		read-snp-limit	Max mismatches per read	int	0-300	300	Exclude reads with more than N base mismatches, ignoring gaps with quality >= mismatch-base-quality-threshold.
#		e	Read indel limit	int	0-100	100	Exclude reads with more than N separate gaps.
		F	Min alternate fraction	float	0-1-2	0.2	Require at least this fraction of observations supporting an alternate allele within a single individual. Default 0.2
		C	Min alternate observations	int	1-100	2	Require at least this many counts supporting the alternate allele within an individual.
		3	Min alternate qsum	int	0-200	0	Require at least this sum of observations supporting an alternate allele
		min-coverage	Min coverage	int	0-200	0	Require at least this coverage to process a site
#		max-coverage	Max coverage	int	100-100000	100000	Do not process sites with greater than this coverage
#		base-quality-cap	Base quality cap	int	1-255	60	Limit estimated observation quality by capping base quality.
		B	Genotyping max iterations	int	10-5000	1000	Iterate no more than N times during genotyping step
#		S	Genotype variant threshold	int	10-10000	10000	Limit posterior integration to samples where the second-best genotype likelihood is no more than log(N) from the highest genotype likelihood for the sample. default: ~unbounded
#		j	Use mapping quality	tickbox	ticked	Use mapping quality of alleles when calculating data likelihoods.
#		H	Harmonic indel quality	tickbox	ticked	Use a weighted sum of base qualities around an indel, scaled by the distance from the indel. By default use a minimum BQ in flanking sequence.
