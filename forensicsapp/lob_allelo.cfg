allelotype	Allelotype	no-rmdup	Allow PCR duplicates	tickbox	ticked	Don't remove PCR duplicates before allelotyping
		min-border	Minimum border	int	0-40	5	Filter reads that do not extend past both ends of the STR region by at least <INT> bp. To include partially spanning reads, specify a large negative number.
		min-bp-before-indel	Min BP before indel	int	1-20	1	Filter reads with an indel occurring less than <INT> bases from either end of the read. [7]
		maximal-end-match	Maximal end match	int	1-30	5	Filter reads whose prefix/suffix matches to reference are <= those obtained when shifting the read ends by distances within <INT> bp [15].
		min-read-end-match	Min read end match	int	1-20	5	Filter reads whose alignments don't exactly match the reference for at least <INT> bp at both ends.
		min-het-freq	Min heterozygous freq	float	0-1-2	0.0	minimum frequency to make a heterozygous call
		max-diff-ref	Max differences from ref	int	0-200	50	Only use reads differing by at most this number of bp from the reference allele. Default: 50
		max-repeats-in-ends	Max flank repeats	int	-1-10	-1	Filter reads with more than <INT> occurrences of the repeat motif in the 4*period bp on either end of the read. -1 means no filter is applied. Default: -1	
		filter-clipped	Filter soft clipped reads	tickbox	unticked	Filter reads with hard or soft clipped bases at the ends
		filter-reads-with-n	Filter reads with Ns	tickbox	unticked	Filter reads that have one or more N bases
