<h1>Updating the MPS Forensics application</h1>
<p>Occasionally updates to the pipeline platform may become available, 
possibly in the form of new command-line arguments for tools, 
improved documentation, or bug fixes. Updating the application - 
which includes the main application, pipeline arguments, documentation 
and the SNP/STR viewer - is as easy as running a single command on 
the command line.</p>
<p><ol>
<li>To update the application, open a terminal window by clicking on 
the first icon in the top left of the screen, on the Ubuntu taskbar. 
</li>
<li>When the box opens with "Search my computer", type "terminal" 
(without the quotes) into the text box. A grey and black icon with 
"Terminal" written under it will become available. Click this.</li>
<li>The terminal window should appear and a prompt will become 
available, which will look something like this:</li>
<img src="images/fresh_terminal.png"></img>
<li>At the $ prompt, type the following and press enter/return 
(don't type the first $ sign below, it represents the prompt 
itself, and note the space between "cd" and "~"):</li>
<p> $ cd ~/mpsforensics </p>
<img src="images/cd_mpsforensics.png"></img>
<li>The prompt should appear to change slightly to indicate that 
you are now in the mpsforensics folder. Type the following and 
press enter/return to pull down the updates:</li>
<p> $ git pull</p>
<li>It should only take a few moments to pull down and apply any 
updates. Whent the $ prompt becomes available again, type the 
following and press enter/return:</li>
<p> $ source locater.sh</p>
<p>This step will likely take one to two minutes to complete as 
the application makes sure it knows where to find the various 
tools and resources it needs to operate correctly. It may not 
appear to be doing anything at first but this is a sign that 
everything is progressing smoothly. After the first 30 seconds 
or so, you will see some messages appear regarding "Candidates 
for" and the names of some files or tools. This list appears 
when multiple installations are present for various tools and 
files, but it is not a problem! For example:</p>
<img src="images/candidates.png"></img>
<li>Once the prompt has appeared again you may close the terminal
window. The updates have been completed and installed.</li>
</ol>
