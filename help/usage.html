<h2>MPS Forensics Pipeline Usage</h2>

<p>Running the MPS Forensics application is as simple as double-clicking 
the link provided by your administrator. Ideally this is placed on the 
desktop, or somewhere else that is equally obvious to find.</p>

<p>When you start the application it will first ensure that the required 
database and web server are running. These are needed by the 
visualisation component of the pipeline. After a 30 second delay 
(to guarantee enough time for these services to start cleanly) the 
main application is started.</p>

<p>The application is composed of a number of tabs, as shown here:</p>

<p>The first tab is a welcome page that also contains three buttons. 
There are the "About", "Help" and "Viewer" buttons. Each launches a 
new tab in the Firefox web browser application. The "About" and "Help" 
buttons open the "About" and "Help" pages respectively, for the 
application. The "viewer" button opens a new tab for the data 
viewer service. The data view is automatically updated at the end 
of each pipeline run.</p>

<p>The data processing pipelines are located under separate tabs. 
The structure, tools, flow and purpose of the pipelines is illustrated 
below:</p>
