<h2>MPS Forensics Pipeline Installation</h2>

<p>Running the MPS Forensics application is as simple as double-clicking the link provided by your administrator. Ideally this is placed on the desktop, or somewhere else that is equally obvious to find.</p>

<p>When you start the application it will first ensure that the required database and web server are running. These are needed by the visualisation component of the pipeline. After a 30 second delay (to guarantee enough time for these services to start cleanly) the main application is started.</p>

<p>The application is composed of a number of tabs. The first of these is a welcome page that also contains three buttons, which launch the viewer service in the Firefox web browser.</p>
