<h2>Using the SNP viewer</h2>
<p>
Once logged in to the SNP/STR Viewer, if you have completed SNP pipeline 
runs with Freebayes or Mpileup, you can view the results by clicking on the 
box directly to the right of the MPS Forensics graphic and choosing your 
data set from the drop down. To make the data show, you will need to change 
the panel to one of the Y-chromosome panels, such as Y-Filer Plus, as shown 
in the image below:</p>

<p>To view the reads and SNP calls for any panel locus, double click on 
the genotype of choice. Another single click will close the image. Clicking 
on the rsID above the genotype will open the appropriate dbSNP entry online.
