<h1>Using the data viewer</h1>
<p>After clicking the "SNP/STR Viewer" button on the home tab of the 
MPS Forensics application, a Firefox browser window will open to the 
data viewer - a meteor web service that has been launched by our 
application on port 3000. If you haven't already created an account 
and logged in, you should see the following:</p>
<img src="images/viewer_not_logged_in.png"></img>
<p>You should create an account using the dialog box on the right 
hand side of the screen. If it doesn't appear to be visible, try 
expanding your browser window.</p>
<img src="images/viewer_create_account.png"></img>
<p>You must fill in your email, password, first and last name. You 
must also accept the terms and conditions
<p>You can see in the image above that there are some text messages 
with no apparent tick boxes. This graphical glitch can be a real pain, 
but the tickbox is there, directly to the left of the 
"I accept the terms and conditions" 
text. If you get a message saying you must accept these, then click 
once just to the left of the "I accept" text and click on "CREATE" 
again.</p>
<p>Now you can log in</p>
<img src="images/viewer_sign_in.png"></img>
<p>There is a simple box at the bottom of each panel view for 
annotations, so each screen can be saved or printed with a message.</p>
