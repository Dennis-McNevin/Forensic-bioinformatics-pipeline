<h1>Adding custom SNP/STR panel files</h1>
<p>The process of filtering SNP/STR calls by locus is usually done 
within the pipeline by intersecting the calls with BED files 
listing the separate "panels" of chosen loci. An attempt has been
made to provide a single standardised file format with all the 
information that is required for this step, to include both SNP 
and STR loci. This file format has been named .pnl (panel) and 
an example is shown below:</p>

<p>The panel file format is closely modelled on the standard BED 
file format in that the first three columns are the same, allowing 
for standard tools such as BEDtools to work with these files, 
e.g. to intersect results with a panel file.</p>
<p>The columns that define a panel file are as follows:
<ol>
<li>Chromosome: any prefix to the chromosomes, e.g. chr in chr16, 
should match the prefix (if any) used in the genomic reference.</li>
<li>Start: The first base in a chromosome is at position 0.</li>
<li>End: This position is 1-more than the final position. E.g. 
a single base SNP at the 50th base in a chromosome would have 
start=49 end=50</li>
<li>rsID/LocusID: the standard identifier for the locus</li>
<li>str/ai/ii/pi: the type of panel this feature belongs to. 
Namely, a Short Tandem Repeat (STR), Ancestry Informative SNP, 
Identity Informative SNP, Phenotypic Informative SNP</li>
<li>Analytic threshold: percentage value</li>
<li>Stochastic threshold: percentage value</li>
<li>Stutter threshold: percentage value</li>
<li>Length;Repeats: ";"-separated values of the repeat motif 
length and the number of expected repeats. Simply use ";" with 
no values for SNP entries.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Note: currently only VCF files produced by Mpileup and  
Freebayes are filtered by the "standard.pnl" panel file as 
LobSTR and STRait Razor require some extra work to accommodate 
the extra information present in their VCF files. To provide 
custom STR loci, the lobSTR_codis_hg19.bed and lobSTR_ystr_hg19.bed 
files need to be replace or modified with the new loci.
