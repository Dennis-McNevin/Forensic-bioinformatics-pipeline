A To Do list

The install stuff for our MPS Forensics app should be in its own subdirectory.

The Splash Screen and the Forensics Home page belong in the forensics app, not in the main driver page.

The pipelines could make much better use of format strings to configure scripts. For example, in modcommon.py where it calls Trimmomatic, code like:
  "SLIDINGWINDOW:%{w}:%{q}"%itrfce['Trimmomatic']
would be clearer and more flexible.

Maybe, the Sliding Window check box for Trimmomatic should activate and inactivate the other options?

Document the auto-configure locator.py code.

Maybe a comprehensive test suit?
